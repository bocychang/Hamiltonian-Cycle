# Hamiltonian-Cycle
The classic problem Hamiltonian path problem and Hamiltonian cycle problem in graph theory are to determine whether there is a Hamiltonian path and a Hamiltonian ring on a given graph, respectively. Both questions are NP-complete. This topic uses a program to implement the Hamiltonian cycle, to determine whether the input has a Hamilton Circuit, and to find a Hamilton Circuit that is NP-complete.
圖論中的經典問題Hamiltonian path problem and Hamiltonian cycle problem分別是來確定在一個給定的圖上是否存在哈密頓路徑和哈密頓環。兩個問題皆為NP-complete。本專題透過程式實現Hamiltonian cycle，判斷輸入是否存在 Hamilton Circuit ，並找到一個 Hamilton Circuit 是 NP-complete。
